HyperCloud-Plugins
==================

This repository is meant to house all HyperCloud Plugin examples.  All Plugin files in this repository are in the HyperCloud export format.  You can simply import these into HyperCloud to create new Plugins.

Plugins can be packaged together with Blueprints in the YAML, and run with the lifecycle parameter for various pre and post executions.  This can be done for single or multi-container based applications, or single or multi-VM based applications.

Plugins can also be run against an actively running single or multi-tier application for various activities such as injecting code, loading software, application or system configuration, and other processes.
